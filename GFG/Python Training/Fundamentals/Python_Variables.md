# Python Variables (short version)

## Naming Convention Rules
- Variable names can only contain letters, digits and underscores (_).
- A variable name cannot start with a digit.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different).
- Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, else, for) as variable names.

## Dynamic Typing (IMPORTANT)
Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning the same variable can hold different types of values during execution.
